# My documents
I will save and share the documentation via this repository.

## Memo

I would like to make a note of how to use this repository.

### HTML

- url $\rightarrow$ use `<a>` tag

### Markdown

If you see an error in your editor, don't worry about it.

- `[text](URL)`
- `[^1]` and `[^1]: text` 
- Before uploading markdown files, replace underbars `_` into ` _ `. (The compiler seems to interpret the bar as *emphasis*.)
