# My documents
I will save and share the documentation via this repository.

## Memo

I would like to make a note of how to use this repository.

### HTML

- url $\rightarrow$ use `<a>` tag

### Markdown

If you see an error in your editor, don't worry about it.

- `[text](URL)`
- `[^1]` and `[^1]: text` 
- Before uploading markdown files, insert spaces before and after underscore `_`. The compiler seems to interpret the bar as *emphasis*, so I have to add the space.
- We also seem to put `$$ \n \end{align} \n $$ \n \begin{align}` because Grammarly usually stops when we write the equations or align too long.
