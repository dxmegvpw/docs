# French

I have been wanting to read Bourbaki's textbook for some time, so here I will carefully read the original one.

## Théorie des ensembles

### Introduction

`Depuis les Grecs, qui dit mathématique dit démonstration;`

- *Since the Greeks, mathematics has been synonymous with demonstration;*













## Word Sheet

- Depuis -> since
- Grecs -> Greek
- qui -> (This word is difficult to explain.)
