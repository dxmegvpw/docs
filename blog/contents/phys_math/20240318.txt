Why the dimension of representation of gamma matrices \(\gamma^{\mu}\) is even?

I will prove why the odd-dimensional representation of the gamma matrices is prohibited. You already have almost the answer to this problem, they are traceless. Let us review its property.

The gamma matrices are defined by the relation
\[
    \{\gamma^{\mu},\gamma^{\nu}\}=2g^{\mu\nu}\cdot\bm{1}_{4}
\]
and it implies the matrices anticommuting with each other.
