    <h2>Why the dimension of representation of gamma matrices \(\gamma^{\mu}\) is even?</h2>

    <p>
        I will prove why the odd-dimensional representation of the gamma matrices is prohibited. You already have almost
        the answer to this problem, they are traceless. Let us review its property.
    </p>

    <p>
        The gamma matrices are defined by the relation
        \[
        \{\gamma^{\mu},\gamma^{\nu}\}=2g^{\mu\nu}\cdot\mathrm{\textbf{1}}_{4}
        \]
        and it implies the matrices anticommuting with each other. Thus we take the trace for the product of two
        different matrices \(\gamma^{\mu}, \gamma^{\nu}\) like
        \[
        \mathrm{tr}[\gamma^{\nu}\gamma^{\mu}\gamma^{\nu}]
        \quad
        (\text{ not summed for indices $\mu$}).
        \]
        Evaluating this form by using the cyclicity of the trace, we find \(
        +\text{tr}\gamma^{\mu}=-\text{tr}\gamma^{\mu} \) and then conclude they are traceless.
