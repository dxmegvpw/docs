    <p>
        I decided to start a dairy to improve my English skills. I think this is very hard work until I get used to it.
        Yesterday, I took the TOEFL iBT test at my home and it was terribly bad. So I decided to do this. I'm so busy
        these days that I can't upload this too much, I guess. I will write as much as I can.<br>

        I will write my goals to clarify what the purpose is.
