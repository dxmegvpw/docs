    <h2>My Zotero setup</h2>

    <p>
        Zotero is one of the most important tools that I use. This application does so many things to organize documents, especially the technical papers. To maximize Zotero's potential, I tweak as many options as possible. I will share these settings and I hope some readers will refer to my options and to enjoy his study life.

        (It is also important for me to leave some notes, since it will help me when I will buy a new PC, for instance.)
