    <h2>My setup for VS Code and LaTeX</h2>

    <p>
        When I write notes or report assignments, I usually use LaTeX since it produces beautifully formatted mathematical equations, and above all, it is enjoyable to use. 
    </p>

    <p>
        To make our LaTeX lives happier, I usually use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for a text editor. It helps us to write TeX code and introduce some features, like Grammarly or git etc., more easily. I cannot imagine my life without VS Code for me. In this notes, I will show you one of the installation and setup examples for LaTeX and VS Code. Our strategies are as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and VS Code.<br>
                We will use a virtual environment and activate LaTeX on it.                
            </li>
            <li>
                Log in to the VS Code account and synchronies the settings. (If you do not have a Microsoft account, you should create one as it will be easier to set up next time).<br>
                Install TeX Live on Linux from the command prompt.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>


    <h3>Install the application</h3>

    <p>
        The VS Code installer is available <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" target="_blank">here</a>. Confirm your Operating System and download appropriate versions to your computer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before (or after) installing, you should also install Ubuntu for your computer. Basically, we will be using the virtual environment and installing LaTeX (and Python, C++, etc.) on it from now on. 
    </p>

    <p>
        You should open the Microsoft Store from the Start menu and find Ubuntu and install it on your PC.
