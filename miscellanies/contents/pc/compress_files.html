    <h2>How to compress folders individually using 7zip</h2>

    <p>
        Sometimes I want to compress several folders individually. I think you will naively select all the target
        folders and compress them using 7zip or another compressor application, but you will find that it does not work
        as expected. If we want to achieve our goals, some tricks are needed.
    </p>

    <h3>Main</h3>

    <p>
        First of all, 7zip needs to be installed. The installer can be downloaded <a
            href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Once on the site, you should get the
        installer for the appropriate Operating System.
    </p>

    <p>
        After downloading, go to the home directory and make <b>zip.bat</b>. (To tell the truth, the location of a bat file is not important in this case. But if you create this file in the home directory, we can easily access the bat file, I guess.)  
    </p>

    <p>
        The contents of the bat file is as follows:<br>
        <p>
            &emsp;@ECHO OFF<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;SET path="(location of the 7zip's exe file)"<br>
            &emsp;SET exeFile=7z.exe<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;:REM Set the password<br>
            &emsp;:SET pass="XXXXXXXX"<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;pass=""<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;FOR %%f IN (%*) DO (<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;%path%%exeFile% a -p%pass% %%~dpf%%~nf.zip %%f<br>
            &emsp;)<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;ECHO The tasks have been completed!<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;pause<br>
        </p>
    </p>

    <p>
        All you have to do then is drag all the folders you want to compress into the .bat file. 7zip will start immediately and create the zip files.

        I referred following articles. Unfortunately, all articles are in Japanese.
