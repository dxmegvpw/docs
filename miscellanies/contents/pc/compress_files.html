    <h2>How to compress folders individually using 7zip</h2>

    <p>
        Sometimes I want to compress several folders individually. I think you will naively select all the target
        folders and compress them using 7zip or another compressor application, but you will find that it does not work
        as expected. If we want to achieve our goals, some tricks are needed.
    </p>

    <h3>Main contents</h3>

    <p>
        First of all, 7zip needs to be installed. The installer can be downloaded <a
            href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Once on the site, you should get the
        installer for the appropriate Operating System.
    </p>

    <p>
        After downloading, make <b>compress_7zip.bat</b> and type contents of the bat file as follows:<br>
        <p>
            &emsp;@echo off<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;for %%f in (%*) do (<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;echo %%f<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" a -mmt=on -mx=9 %%~dpf%%~nf.zip %%f<br>
            &emsp;)<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;pause<br>
        </p>
        [<a href="temp/compress_7zip.bat" target="_blank">compress_7zip.bat</a>]
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Both <b>-mnt=on</b> and <b>-mx=9</b> are options.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>-mnt=on</b> enable us to multithreading.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>-mx=9</b> is a compression ratio settings.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        All you have to do then is drag all the folders you want to compress into the .bat file. 7zip will start immediately and create the zip files.
