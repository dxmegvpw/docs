  abstract = {Bulk quantum fields are often said to contribute to the generalized entropy \${\textbackslash}frac\{A\}\{4G\_N\} +S\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{bulk\}\}\$ only at \$O(1)\$. Nonetheless, in the context of evaporating black holes, \$O(1/G\_N)\$ gradients in \$S\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{bulk\}\}\$ can arise due to large boosts, introducing a quantum extremal surface far from any classical extremal surface. We examine the effect of such bulk quantum effects on quantum extremal surfaces (QESs) and the resulting entanglement wedge in a simple two-boundary \$2d\$ bulk system defined by Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity coupled to a 1+1 CFT. Turning on a coupling between one boundary and a further external auxiliary system which functions as a heat sink allows a two-sided otherwise-eternal black hole to evaporate on one side. We find the generalized entropy of the QES to behave as expected from general considerations of unitarity, and in particular that ingoing information disappears from the entanglement wedge after a scambling time \${\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}beta\}\{2{\textbackslash}pi\} {\textbackslash}ln {\textbackslash}Delta S + O(1)\$ in accord with expectations for holographic implementations of the Hayden-Preskill protocol. We also find an interesting QES phase transition at what one might call the Page time for our process.},

  abstract = {Ryu and Takayanagi conjectured a formula for the entanglement (von Neumann) entropy of an arbitrary spatial region in an arbitrary holographic field theory. The von Neumann entropy is a special case of a more general class of entropies called Renyi entropies. Using Euclidean gravity, Fursaev computed the entanglement Renyi entropies (EREs) of an arbitrary spatial region in an arbitrary holographic field theory, and thereby derived the RT formula. We point out, however, that his EREs are incorrect, since his putative saddle points do not in fact solve the Einstein equation. We remedy this situation in the case of two-dimensional CFTs, considering regions consisting of one or two intervals. For a single interval, the EREs are known for a general CFT; we reproduce them using gravity. For two intervals, the RT formula predicts a phase transition in the entanglement entropy as a function of their separation, and that the mutual information between the intervals vanishes for separations larger than the phase transition point. By computing EREs using gravity and CFT techniques, we find evidence supporting both predictions. We also find evidence that large-\$N\$ symmetric-product theories have the same EREs as holographic ones.},

  abstract = {The black hole information paradox is a very poorly understood problem. It is often believed that Hawking's argument is not precisely formulated, and a more careful accounting of naturally occurring quantum corrections will allow the radiation process to become unitary. We show that such is not the case, by proving that small corrections to the leading order Hawking computation cannot remove the entanglement between the radiation and the hole. We formulate Hawking's argument as a `theorem': assuming `traditional' physics at the horizon and usual assumptions of locality we will be forced into mixed states or remnants. We also argue that one cannot explain away the problem by invoking AdS/CFT duality. We conclude with recent results on the quantum physics of black holes which show the the interior of black holes have a `fuzzball' structure. This nontrivial structure of microstates resolves the information paradox, and gives a qualitative picture of how classical intuition can break down in black hole physics.},

They appear in the form of unconditional and conditional entropies, relative entropies or mutual information, and have found many applications in information theory and beyond. Various generalizations of Renyi entropies to the quantum setting have been proposed, most notably Petz's quasi-entropies and Renner's conditional min-, max- and collision entropy. Here, we argue that previous quantum extensions are incompatible and thus unsatisfactory. We propose a new quantum generalization of the family of Renyi entropies that contains the von Neumann entropy, min-entropy, collision entropy and the max-entropy as special cases, thus encompassing most quantum entropies in use today. We show several natural properties for this definition, including data-processing inequalities, a duality relation, and an entropic uncertainty relation.},

  abstract = {When absorbing boundary conditions are used to evaporate a black hole in AdS/CFT, we show that there is a phase transition in the location of the quantum Ryu-Takayanagi surface, at precisely the Page time. The new RT surface lies slightly inside the event horizon, at an infalling time approximately the scrambling time \${\textbackslash}beta/2{\textbackslash}pi {\textbackslash}log S\_\{BH\}\$ into the past. We can immediately derive the Page curve, using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, and the Hayden-Preskill decoding criterion, using entanglement wedge reconstruction. Because part of the interior is now encoded in the early Hawking radiation, the decreasing entanglement entropy of the black hole is exactly consistent with the semiclassical bulk entanglement of the late-time Hawking modes, despite the absence of a firewall. By studying the entanglement wedge of highly mixed states, we can understand the state dependence of the interior reconstructions. A crucial role is played by the existence of tiny, non-perturbative errors in entanglement wedge reconstruction. Directly after the Page time, interior operators can only be reconstructed from the Hawking radiation if the initial state of the black hole is known. As the black hole continues to evaporate, reconstructions become possible that simultaneously work for a large class of initial states. Using similar techniques, we generalise Hayden-Preskill to show how the amount of Hawking radiation required to reconstruct a large diary, thrown into the black hole, depends on both the energy and the entropy of the diary. Finally we argue that, before the evaporation begins, a single, state-independent interior reconstruction exists for any code space of microstates with entropy strictly less than the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and show that this is sufficient state dependence to avoid the AMPSS typical-state firewall paradox.},

  abstract = {The AdS/CFT correspondence provides a rich testing ground for many important topics in theoretical physics. The earliest and most striking example of the correspondence is the conjectured duality between the energy spectrum of type IIB superstring theory on AdS\_5 x S\^5 and the operator anomalous dimensions of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. While there is a substantial amount of evidence in support of this conjecture, direct tests have been elusive. The difficulty of quantizing superstring theory in a curved Ramond-Ramond background is compounded by the problem of computing anomalous dimensions for non-BPS operators in the strongly coupled regime of the gauge theory. The former problem can be circumvented to some extent by taking a Penrose limit of AdS\_5 x S\^5, reducing the background to that of a pp-wave (where the string theory is soluble). A corresponding limit of the gauge theory was discovered by Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase, who obtained successful agreement between a class of operator dimensions in this limit and corresponding string energies in the Penrose limit. In this dissertation we present a body of work based largely on the introduction of worldsheet interaction corrections to the free pp-wave string theory by lifting the Penrose limit of AdS\_5 x S\^5. This provides a new class of rigorous tests of AdS/CFT that probe a truly quantum realm of the string theory. By studying the correspondence in greater detail, we stand to learn not only about how the duality is realized on a more microscopic level, but how Yang-Mills theories behave at strong coupling. The methods presented here will hopefully contribute to the realization of these important goals.},
